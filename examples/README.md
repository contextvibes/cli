# Purpose of this Directory

This directory and its subdirectories (`hello-world/`, `another-example/`) do **not** contain examples of how to use the `contextvibes` CLI.

Instead, they serve as a **live testbed** for the `contextvibes run` command itself.

The `contextvibes run` command is designed to discover and execute runnable example applications within a target Go project. To test this discovery and execution functionality during the development of the CLI, we need a set of example applications to run against. These directories provide that test case.
