# Applies programmatic code modifications or deletions from a JSON script.

Reads a JSON script file describing a series of operations to be applied to
specified files in the codebase. This enables automated or AI-assisted refactoring and cleanup.

If --script is not provided, it looks for 'codemod.json' in the current directory.
