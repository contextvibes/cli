# Compiles the Go project's main application.

Detects a Go project and compiles its main application.

By default, this command looks for a single subdirectory within the 'cmd/' directory
to determine the main package to build. It produces an optimized, stripped binary
in the './bin/' directory.

Use the --debug flag to compile with debugging symbols included.
