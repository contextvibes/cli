# Starts an AI-guided strategic project planning session.

This command initiates an interactive session to gather high-level project
details. It then generates a comprehensive master prompt file that you can
use with an external AI (like Gemini or Claude) to facilitate a detailed
strategic kickoff discussion for your project.
