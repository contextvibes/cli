# Stages all changes and commits them with a provided message.

Stages all current changes (tracked and untracked) in the working directory
and commits them locally using the message provided via the -m/--message flag.

Commit message validation is active by default, expecting a Conventional Commits format.
This can be configured in '.contextvibes.yaml'.
