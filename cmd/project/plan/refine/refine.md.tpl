# Refine Backlog Issues

Guides you through an interactive session to clean up and classify work items in your project's backlog.

This command finds all open issues that do not have a primary type label (e.g., 'epic', 'story', 'task', 'bug', 'chore'). For each unclassified issue, it will display its title and body and prompt you to assign the correct type. This is a key Scrum Master activity for maintaining a healthy and well-organized backlog.
