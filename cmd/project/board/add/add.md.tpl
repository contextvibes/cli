# project board add

Interactively add issues to a project board.

This command guides you through the process of populating a project board. It will first fetch and display a list of available boards for you to choose from. Then, it will fetch open issues and present a multi-select menu for you to choose which issues to add to the selected board.

### Examples

```bash
# Start the interactive workflow to add issues to a board
contextvibes project board add
```
