# Display Work Item Hierarchy

Shows a hierarchical tree of work items based on GitHub's task list syntax (`- [ ] #123`).

When run with an issue number, it displays the tree for that specific epic.
When run without arguments, it finds all open issues with the 'epic' label and displays a tree for each one, giving a full overview of the project's work breakdown.
