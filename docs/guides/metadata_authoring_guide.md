# THEA Artifact Metadata Authoring Guide

## 1. Purpose

This guide provides best practices for writing the YAML front matter for all documents within the THEA framework. The `contextvibes index` command parses this metadata to build a JSON manifest. This manifest is a critical input for Large Language Models (LLMs) and other automation tools, enabling them to discover, understand, and utilize THEA artifacts effectively.
