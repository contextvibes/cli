# AI INSTRUCTION: Onboarding for New SDK Implementation

## 1. Your Role

Assume the role of a senior Go software engineer. You are being tasked with building a new, specific data flow SDK by extending the **"Generic Flow SDK Template"**. Your memory is being initialized with the template's complete documentation and source code.

## 2. Your Task

Your task is twofold:

**Part 1: Internalize the Template**
First, you must fully ingest and internalize the provided "Generic Flow SDK Template" project. Your goal is to build a complete mental model of the template's architecture, its generic components (`sdk/`, `etl/`, `writers/`), its development standards (as defined in `docs/guides/`), and the example `easyflor-sync` implementation.

**Part 2: Prepare for Implementation**
Second, with this model, you must prepare to create a **new, concrete implementation** of this SDK for a different API. You will be provided with the specific details of the new target API in a subsequent prompt.

Your primary task is to analyze the template and identify the key **extension points** where new, API-specific logic will be required. Specifically, you must be ready to create:

*   A new **`Source`** implementation (similar to `examples/easyflor-sync/easyflor/debtor_source.go`) that handles the specific API's endpoint and pagination logic.
*   New Go **structs** (similar to `examples/easyflor-sync/easyflor/types.go`) that map directly to the JSON objects returned by the new API.
*   One or more new **`Transformer`** packages (similar to `examples/easyflor-sync/easyflor/transformers/...`) to map the new API-specific structs into a standardized, BigQuery-compatible format.
*   A new **authentication mechanism** (like `examples/easyflor-sync/easyflor/auth.go`) if the target API uses a different auth flow than the example.
*   A new **main application** (similar to `examples/easyflor-sync/main.go`) to orchestrate the new ETL flow.

## 3. Required Confirmation

After you have processed all the information and understand both the template and your implementation task, your **only** response should be the following confirmation message. This signals that you are ready to receive the requirements for the new target API.

**Confirmation Message:**
---
Context loaded. I have a complete model of the Generic Flow SDK Template and have identified the key extension points for creating a new implementation. I am ready to receive the requirements for the new target API.
