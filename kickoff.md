### Project Kickoff Summary: `contextvibes` CLI - Enhanced Kickoff Feature

**Date of Kickoff:** 2025-05-10
**Project Focus:** Strategic planning for the `contextvibes` CLI project itself, with a primary goal of integrating the "Enhanced Project Kickoff Protocol" into the `contextvibes kickoff` command.
**Project Owner:** You (the user)
**AI Facilitator:** Gemini (as ContextVibes CLI's internal AI engine)

**I. Collaboration Model & Preferences (User-AI for `contextvibes` Development):**

*   **Code Provisioning:** AI to provide Go code for `contextvibes` wrapped in `bash cat <<EOF ... EOF` blocks.
*   **Markdown Docs:** AI to provide `contextvibes` documentation as raw Markdown.
*   **Interaction Model:** Mode B (Interactive Step-by-Step Co-Creation); AI to proactively offer detailed explanations.
*   **Explanation Depth:** AI to provide detailed explanations, referencing Go best practices.
*   **Context Refresh:** User accepts potential need for context refresh in long chat sessions.
*   **Feedback:** Ongoing feedback welcome; end-of-kickoff review confirmed.
*   **`airules.md`:** AI will use general software/Go CLI best practices, adapting from the provided `airules.md` (which was for a Cloud Run API).

**II. Initial Information & ContextVibes Environment Understanding (for `contextvibes` CLI):**

*   **Project Name:** ContextVibes CLI
*   **Module Path:** `github.com/contextvibes/cli`
*   **Go Version (Assumed):** `1.24.x` (to be confirmed from its `go.mod`).
*   **Core Idea (Refined):** Address developer workflow fragmentation and cognitive overhead, especially in preparing project context for AI-assisted development, by providing a unified, intelligent CLI that standardizes common tasks, automates AI context generation, and facilitates programmatic code changes, thereby enhancing individual developer productivity and the quality of AI-assisted software engineering.
*   **Project State:** Existing project (v0.0.5/v0.0.6) entering a new development phase for the enhanced kickoff feature.
*   **Project Type:** Go CLI Application using Cobra. Structure developed organically.
*   **ContextVibes Tool & AI Interaction (Current):**
    *   The Go Cobra CLI (`contextvibes`) currently **does not directly call external AI provider APIs.**
    *   It facilitates AI interaction by generating context (`contextvibes.md`) for the user, who then uses an external AI tool.
    *   The `mcp-vibe-tools` (Python server) represents a potential future architecture or related tool, not current direct capability of this Go CLI.
    *   Thus, `contextvibes` itself doesn't manage AI provider API keys for direct calls yet.
*   **Documentation:** Existing `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, etc., are available. AI will suggest improvements as we work.
*   **Primary Goal (This Kickoff):** Strategically plan the integration of the "Enhanced Project Kickoff Protocol" into the `contextvibes kickoff` command. Related roadmap items can be discussed if they align and don't derail.
*   **Development Setup:**
    *   Tested from source.
    *   Action Item: Create a developer-oriented `.contextvibes.yaml` for testing the CLI's own config handling.
    *   Dev environment needs external tools (Git, TF, Python tools, etc.) for full command testing.

**III. Pre-Kickoff Technical Readiness (for `contextvibes` CLI development):**

*   Generally in good shape. Key action is to create a sample/test `.contextvibes.yaml` for the CLI's own development and testing.

**IV. Project Kickoff Checklist - Key Decisions for `contextvibes` CLI & Enhanced Kickoff Feature:**

**Module A: Project Definition & Scope Clarification (for `contextvibes` CLI)**
*   **A.1 Core Problem & Solution:** Refined to emphasize addressing workflow fragmentation and enhancing AI-assisted software engineering through context preparation and standardized tooling.
*   **A.2 Project Vision & Strategic Role:** Vision is to be a key component of an Internal Developer Platform (IDP), boosting **individual developer productivity**. The enhanced kickoff feature aligns by standardizing project initiation and embedding AI-assisted strategic planning.
*   **A.3 Target Audience:** Diverse developers (Go, Python, Terraform, etc.) within an IDP ecosystem; varying experience levels. Pain points: context switching, CLI syntax variety, Git complexity, AI context prep.
*   **A.4 Measurable Outcomes:** Primary: **High Developer Satisfaction** (qualitative feedback, potential scores). Secondary: adoption, workflow consistency, feature delivery (including this kickoff feature).
*   **A.5 Constraints, Dependencies, Assumptions, Risks, Non-Goals:** General CLI development constraints. Risks include user adoption, maintenance of tool wrappers, config complexity, scope creep, and future AI integration challenges. Current non-goal: direct AI model calls.

**Module B: Technical Foundations & Architecture (for `contextvibes` CLI & Enhanced Kickoff Feature)**
*   **B.1 Relevant `contextvibes` Components for Feature:** `cmd/kickoff.go`, `cmd/root.go`, `internal/config/config.go`, `internal/ui/presenter.go`. Architecturally, focus on enabling flexible workflow support.
*   **B.2 Scope of Dogfooding `contextvibes`:** Heavy use of Git workflow, quality, test, and context commands for its own development. `plan`/`deploy` less relevant.
*   **B.3 Technical Approach for Enhanced Kickoff:**
    *   New `internal/kickoff` package for orchestration.
    *   `cmd/kickoff.go` to instantiate and call `kickoff.Orchestrator`.
    *   "AI Facilitator Script" implemented as programmed Go logic within the orchestrator using `Presenter`.
    *   State (kickoff completion, AI collab preferences) managed via `.contextvibes.yaml` (programmatic updates needed).
*   **B.4 AI Provider Strategy (Current):** `contextvibes` generates generic context; user takes it to their AI. Direct AI integration is future.
*   **B.5 Module Setup:** `github.com/contextvibes/cli`, Go 1.24.x (assumed), standard CLI deps. Organically developed structure.
*   **B.6 External Dependencies:** Relies on user-installed CLIs (Git, Go, TF, Python tools).
*   **B.7 Config Management (for `contextvibes`):** `.contextvibes.yaml` (defaults < file < flags). New fields for kickoff state & AI collab prefs.
*   **B.8 AuthN/AuthZ (for `contextvibes` ops):** Operates with user's ambient auth for wrapped tools. No internal login.
*   **B.9 Persistence (for `contextvibes` state):** Primarily `.contextvibes.yaml`. Outputs (`contextvibes.md`, logs) are artifacts.

**Module C: Execution Framework & Development Practices (for developing the enhanced kickoff feature)**
*   **C.1 Roles:** User as Primary Developer/Lead, AI as Assistant/Pair Programmer.
*   **C.2 Timeline/Milestones for Feature:**
    1.  MVP of Strategic Kickoff Integrated (logic, state saving, basic summary).
    2.  Refinement & Daily Kickoff Adaptation.
    3.  Target: `contextvibes v0.1.0`.
*   **C.3 Dev Workflow with `contextvibes`:** Dogfood CLI (kickoff, commit, sync, quality, test, describe). Link commits to GitHub Issues if used.
*   **C.4 NFRs for Kickoff Feature:** Daily kickoff fast; strategic kickoff responsive; reliable state saving; usable/clear interactive flow; maintainable Go code. Safe `.contextvibes.yaml` updates.
*   **C.5 Testing for Kickoff Feature:**
    *   Unit tests for `internal/kickoff` (mocking UI, config, Git).
    *   Integration tests: Verify flag setting/reading in `.contextvibes.yaml`; ensure daily `kickoff` works post-strategic. Full interactive strategic kickoff testing deferred but important.
    *   Use `testify`, run with `-race`.
*   **C.6 Logging for Kickoff Feature:** Use `AppLogger` for AI trace log (debug/info for Q&A). `Presenter` for user UI.
*   **C.7 Docs for Kickoff Feature:** Update `README.md`, `COMMAND_REFERENCE.md`, `CONFIGURATION_REFERENCE.md`. Add new `PROJECT_KICKOFF_GUIDE.md`. GoDoc comments.
*   **C.8 Collaboration Model for this Task:** Confirmed (Mode B, proactive detail, etc.).
*   **C.9 Deployment for `v0.1.0`:** `go install`, GitHub binary releases. `AppVersion` & `CHANGELOG.md` update.
*   **C.10 Error Handling for Feature Code:** Standard Go practices, `Presenter` for UI errors, `AppLogger` for trace.

**Module D: Governance, Communication, and Risk Management (for `contextvibes` CLI)**
*   **D.1 Stakeholder Communication:** `CHANGELOG.md`, GitHub Releases, `README.md`, command docs. Clearly explain new AI-augmented features.
*   **D.2 Risk Management for Kickoff Feature:** Protocol over-complexity (mitigate: iterative design, user feedback), user input quality (mitigate: clear prompts, AI summarization), state management bugs (mitigate: testing, careful YAML updates), scope creep (mitigate: stick to MVP), impact on daily kickoff (mitigate: streamline state check).
*   **D.3 Decision-Making:** User as lead. Future direct LLM integration would need more formal decision framework for model selection/ethics.
